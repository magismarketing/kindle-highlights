The amateur salesperson goes for the close too soon. Charging forward and looking aggressive, the amateur salesperson sets the hook prematurely. The result? No sale.

See the subtle reverse? The loosening of the line? Instead of moving in for what looked like the obvious close, the salesperson gently moved away, all the while setting the hook a little tighter.
Now watch the line tighten up as the prospect responds:

PROSPECT: Sure. I’ll use it by …

Do you see what’s happening? The prospect himself is closing! What could be easier?
To sell like a pro, I suggest you learn to set the hook only when you hear the prospect buy. Even then, one more gentle reverse won’t hurt: “Mr. Smith, just what would you like me to do now?” When Mr. Smith speaks, the sale is closed. Now that’s exciting!

One day I called on a particular company just while I was beginning to develop my Reversing techniques. I got to the end of my presentation, and the prospect said to me, “You know, I really like what you have. But I have a longstanding rule. I never make decisions the first time I see something.”
My immediate response was to use this reverse:
“That’s not a problem. I also have a longstanding rule. I never come back. Now, what do we do?”
I closed the sale. And that’s when I learned to stop handling stalls and objections and to start Reversing!

But what about the prospect who says, “Yes, it is over.” It happens, but only rarely. In that event, the salesperson says: “Before I leave, now that it’s over, can I ask you a question?” (That’s Lieutenant Columbo talking, by the way: “Oh, one more thing …”)
The prospect always says “yes” to this request. The next question—regardless of what it is—starts up the selling process once again, with a chance to get the prospect into motion.
Here’s another way to approach the prospect who says it’s over: “Now that it is over, can I stop being a salesperson for a minute and be a consultant?” Or if you don’t like the word “salesperson,” say: “Can I take off my technical hat for a moment and be a consultant?” This sets up an opportunity for the salesperson to say whatever is on his or her mind. There’s no sense in holding back now. The prospect is at nine o’clock; if he can’t be set in motion, it makes no difference what you say or do. So don’t hold back! Your response just might get the prospect moving, and then you’re back in the selling process.
How about the prospect who begins at 270 degrees (sold)? A safe and easy close? That’s what the traditionally trained salesperson thinks. But wait a minute. How did the prospect get to three o’clock so fast? By reading a brochure, seeing an ad, or talking to a friend? Maybe so, but before I explain how to handle this situation, try this:
Stick your arm out at the 270 position. Notice how it got there? You had to swing it out or up, didn’t you? How long can you hold it there? Depending on their physical condition, some people can hold it there longer than others. But eventually—remember what Newton said—the arm will have to come down. Things in motion stay in motion! Sooner or later the arm will fall; we just don’t know when. That’s precisely the danger of meeting with a prospect who’s in the sold position. A prospect who’s “too sold” too early is dangerous, unless the salesperson knows how to handle the situation. What should the professional salesperson do? Move to the 180 position and gently reverse the prospect into motion. After a couple of reverses, the prospect will no longer be “oversold.” So the salesperson can let go. What happens? The prospect will swing back to 270, where the sale will be successfully closed.

 In your capacity to see it. Stop doing that and everything will be fine. Let the part of you that makes that judgment keep quiet even if the body it’s attached to is stabbed or burnt, or stinking with pus, or consumed by cancer.

 No. It’s fortunate that this has happened and I’ve remained unharmed by it—not shattered by the present or frightened of the future. It could have happened to anyone. But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it. Why treat the one as a misfortune rather than the other as fortunate? Can you really call something a misfortune that doesn’t violate human nature? Or do you think something that’s not against nature’s will can violate it? But you know what its will is. Does what’s happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness, and all the other qualities that allow a person’s nature to fulfill itself?
 So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.

The bullish big belt must have an opening price near the low of the candlestick, and it must also have a closing price near the high of the candlestick (see Figure 9.7).

Even more critical, the big belt candlestick must print on a zone. If the big belt candlestick is not on a zone, the odds of the trade working out fall considerably.

You do the math. Your net income will go from $1.5 million to $2.25 million. How can you begrudge Johnny $250,000, given that increase in profit? It’s essentially a two-for-one trade in your favor. Johnny’s hard work will put $500,000 into the company’s coffers. (This example assumes that your company wasn’t already growing. If it was, you would structure the incentive based on his ability to outpace current growth. For example, if the company had been growing at 20 percent the last three years and Johnny was able to increase it to 50 percent, that additional 30 percent would be attributed to him.)

Here are the keys to creating the most effective compensation structure:

1. Decide what behavior or final result you want to recognize.
2. Study the current compensation structure within your industry. Even if you’re going to disrupt the status quo, you first need to know what the status quo is.
3. Find ways to create three tiers of incentives to strive for. This is much more effective than one all-or-nothing incentive to compete for.

Don’t drag the firing out, but don’t go nuclear, either. Time does not heal all wounds, nor does it make someone who is incompetent suddenly, magically competent.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Before you get married, you can say to your spouse-to-be, “I love you, but we don’t know where we’ll be five, ten, fifteen years from now. Let’s plan for the worst but expect the best. That means we figure out right now what happens in a worst-case scenario—a divorce—in terms of money, the kids, and everything else.” In other words, let’s plan at least five moves ahead.
After a few dates with Jennifer, the woman who would become my wife (this was long before our Hawaii trip), we went to a bookstore on Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica and bought a book titled 101 Questions to Ask Before You Get Engaged. One of the questions was: How many children do you want to have? I answered five; my wife answered three. We ended up having three kids, which now feels like the perfect number. We made an agreement on that and other issues, and my wi

The romantics may argue that by signing a contract, you’re planning to fail. The realists see it as something every smart business owner understands: contingency planning. In business, you’re going to have relationships with employees, partners, investors, suppliers, and advisers. You might love each and every one of those people, but if you don’t have a formal agreement, you’re asking for the type of stress and financial loss that comes with the most contentious of divorces.

Typically, entrepreneurs move from trust to distrust and back again in a predictable pattern. It pays to be aware of this pattern, since it’s going to govern how much leeway you give your people.
When you hire people, your willingness to trust them is low and your desire to micromanage their work is high. After they’ve been on the job for a while and they’ve done good work, your trust is high and you are much less likely to micromanage them.

All fear around your sexuality is a result of feeling inferior or unworthy. If you’re afraid to approach a woman, it’s because somewhere inside you are more invested in her opinion of you than you are in your own opinion of yourself. If you’re afraid to ask a woman to come home with you, it’s because you are afraid of the sexual reality that you want to sleep with her — you’re more invested in her not rejecting you than you are in aligning yourself with your desires.

Note: 1. Fucking around (not getting fucked) a lot of guys aka a bitch.
2. Her Dating morons. We only date who we are, so if she dates a small town asshole then she is most likely to be like him. 
3. Lying
4. Social bitches


The biggest red flag is: Unauthentic-> when her identity (smart bitch) doesn’t mirror her thoughts nor her actions.

What I’m saying is, women who only care about things such as looks and money are usually going to be women who you’re not going to be interested in or who are not going to make you happy. So you’re not missing out on much.

Note: It’s sad because this is more than 80% of the population of the world. 

But hey, when you start to see women like job applications. 

You need to understand that not everybody is destined to be an accountant. 

If you see it from a doctor’s perspective: 70% of the people that study to become MDs end up as a general doctor, only 2-5% of them become heart surgeons. 

So it comes back to the same thing, not all women should be dated, because it’s impossible for all the shoes of all sizes to perfectly fit inside yours.

Much like a thermostat, your identity regulates your internal self‐worth. It regulates your actions and results. Many people are under the false assumption that external factors are what regulates your thermostat. They believe that getting a promotion, getting married to the love of your life, or getting an advanced degree from college determines their identity.
If you don't raise your identity, then eventually you will turn the air conditioning of your life on sooner or later, and that temperature will drop back down to 75 degrees, or some other setting you don't want, simply because you didn't take charge and decide what identity you wanted.
However, if your thermostat is set the right way, it will transcend conditions and you will find success no matter what the external conditions are.

Here's an exercise I use to destroy self‐sabotage, discouragement, and doubt. I pay attention when I have a self‐sabotaging thought. I mentally record that thought. Then, I visualize and see myself scratching it out. The first time I record the thought and strike it out, I'll still see it. So I do this repeatedly, as many times as it takes, until I can no longer see the thought because it is so marked over and blacked out. When I get to the point where I can't see it, the thought has been stricken from my mind. My mind no longer lives with the thought, and that thought loses its limiting power on me.

we use the obvious devices like “early bird discounts” and extend-a-pay monthly installments tied to a deadline to motivate early registrations. But we also use bonuses, entries into prize drawings, backstage-pass opportunities, preferred seating, closed-door, limited-number luncheon tickets available only to the first 50 or first 100 to beat the deadline in order to create even more urgency. Retail mimics this with the “door buster sales” starting at 5 A.M., 6 A.M., or 7 A.M., and can increase that urgency with a gift for the first x-number to be there with noses pressed against the glass. Disney creates false limited supply by bringing a product like a movie DVD, in their language, “out of the Disney vault just until Halloween—then it goes back in the vault and can’t be had.” They periodically bring the same product out of the vault, run the same short promotion, return it to the vault, wait until consumers have forgotten about the promotion, and then trot it out again.
