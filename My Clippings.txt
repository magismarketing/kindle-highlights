A glutton isn’t just someone who eats or drinks too much. Some of us are also gluttons for punishment. Gluttons for attention. Gluttons for control. Gluttons for work. What makes this so tricky to identify, let alone to manage, is that it often comes from a good place, as it did for Martin Luther King Jr. We feel obligated. We feel bad spending money. We feel guilty asking for help. No matter how well-intentioned, the outcome is the same: We wear ourselves down. We harm ourselves, we harm the cause, we neglect the main thing. We end up depriving the world of progress—of the benefits of what economists call the law of comparative advantage.

Once you have established your 12 week goals, tactics will then need to be determined. The easiest way to do this is to break your 12 week goal down to its individual parts. For example, if your 12 week goal is to earn $10,000 and lose 10 pounds, you should write tactics for your income goal and your weight loss goal separately.

Effective measurement captures both lead and lag indicators that provide comprehensive feedback necessary for informed decision making. Lag indicators—things like income, sales, commission dollars, pounds lost, body fat percentage, overall cholesterol levels—represent the end results that you are striving to achieve.

Keep in mind that you started with a vision, a compelling vision of the future that is bigger than the present. Then you established a set of 12 week goals that are aligned with that vision. For each goal, you developed actions or tactics that describe the steps that you must take to achieve your goals. The element you have the most direct control over is the execution of your tactics. Knowing to what degree you followed through on those tactics is the execution measure. Because your 12 week goals were established in light of your longer-term vision, the execution measure also represents progress toward your vision.

The easy way out is to simply stop using the system and turn off the light that is shining on your performance breakdowns. Typically, this takes the form of passive resistance and you put off scoring your week and tell yourself that you’ll get to it later, but later never comes. The other way is to use productive tension as a catalyst for change. Instead of responding to the discomfort by bailing out, high achievers use the tension as an impetus to move forward. If you decide that quitting is not an option, then the discomfort of productive tension will eventually compel you to take action on your tactics. This encourages you to move forward by executing your plan.

When these conflicts are over, a new world order is created, and the cycle begins again.

As I mentioned earlier, Erick Brownstein is the president and chief strategy officer of Shareability (and has created digital content for Cristiano Ronaldo, the Olympics, Adobe, AT&T, and many other major corporations and celebrities). He explains that linear storytelling doesn’t apply to social videos—it doesn’t help you capture attention within the first three seconds. Instead, he advises social-content creators to consider giving away the gags at the beginning of their videos. Shareability’s videos will often give away the punch line or the emotional reveal within the first ten seconds. They do so because it gives the videos a better chance of being more engaging and even going viral. When coupled with more obvious visual storytelling tactics—including optimizing content for mobile phones, using close-up images, and shooting with proper lighting—putting the most interesting or emotional parts of your content in the beginning helps you capture attention quickly.

Naveen Gowda reminds us that you have three seconds to present the structure and establish a promise about the effect the video will have on the viewer. Don’t go slow, but also don’t jump into things too quickly or rush. Instead, use the first three seconds to establish the scene. Create some kind of action or an unresolved situation.

Make sure people can follow the steps or the information in the video you produce in the same way a person would speak about it. Gowda says the visuals should follow the rhythm of “First do this, then this, and then that.” This easy-to-understand format sets the stage. It makes audiences believe, I’m going to be able to follow this. It starts the chain of thinking, Okay, what’s next? Also, he adds that this linear form of communication doesn’t solely apply to instructional videos—in fact, all videos should be structured linearly.

Resistance Is Invisible   Resistance cannot be seen, heard, touched, or smelled. But it can be felt. We experience it as an energy field radiating from a work-in-potential.   Resistance is a repelling force. It’s negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work.

Resistance Is Insidious   Resistance will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work. It will perjure, fabricate, falsify; seduce, bully, cajole. Resistance is protean. It will assume any form, if that’s what it takes to deceive you.   Resistance will reason with you like a lawyer or jam a nine-millimeter in your face like a stickup man.

Resistance has no conscience. It will pledge anything to get a deal, then double-cross you as soon as your back is turned. If you take Resistance at its word, you deserve everything you get.   Resistance is always lying and always full of shit.

Resistance Is Impersonal   Resistance is not out to get you personally. It doesn’t know who you are and doesn’t care. Resistance is a force of nature. It acts objectively.   Though it feels malevolent, Resistance in fact operates with the indifference of rain and transits the heavens by the same laws as stars. When we marshal our forces to combat Resistance, we must remember this.

I like the idea of stubbornness because it’s less lofty than “tenacity” or “perseverance.” We don’t have to be heroes to be stubborn. We can just be pains in the butt.   When we’re stubborn, there’s no quit in us. We’re mean. We’re mulish. We’re ornery.   We’re in till the finish.   We will sink our junkyard-dog teeth into Resistance’s ass and not let go, no matter how hard he kicks.

There’s an exercise that Patricia Ryan Madson describes in her wonderful book, Improv Wisdom. (Ms. Madson taught improvisational theater at Stanford to standing-room only classes for twenty years.) Here’s the exercise:   Imagine a box with a lid. Hold the box in your hand. Now open it.   What’s inside?   It might be a frog, a silk scarf, a gold coin of Persia. But here’s the trick: no matter how many times you open the box, there is always something in it.   Ask me my religion. That’s it.   I believe with unshakeable faith that there will always be something in the box.

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
